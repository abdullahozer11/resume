My Resume
=========

This repo contains my resume in several languages. This is the English one.

You can find the French one
[here](https://github.com/abdullahozer11/resume/tree/master/fr).

It is written in [LaTeX](<https://www.latex=project.org/>).

The design is forked from
[this repo](https://github.com/lohiermichael/resume).

To be able to use pdf to png conversion automatisation.
```
make install
or
poetry install
```
And then to use the convert_pdf_to_png script
```
make convert
```

See convert_pdf_to_png.py script for details and customizations.

Here is the resulting png:
